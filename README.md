Project 001 of Udacity's Autonomous Aerial Engineer ("Flying Car") Nanodegree, "Backyard Flyer".

This project was a basic introduction to the Udacidrone simulator, programming the quadrotor as a state machine, and creating waypoints for your quadrotor to follow -- as seen in backyard_flyer.py.

## To complete this project on your local machine, follow these instructions:
### Environment Setup (~30 minutes)

### Environment Setup Instructions
Read through the instructions below. If these commands look familiar to you, then you should use these VERY abbreviated instructions to get yourself set up.
  1. [Download Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and then install by opening the file/app that you download.
  2. ```sh git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit.git ``` to clone the starter kit and then ```sh cd FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit ``` nto that directory. If you have a windows machine, you must rename ```sh meta_windows_patch.yml ``` to ```sh meta.yml ``` as well.
  3. ```sh conda env create -f environment.yml ``` to create the miniconda environment: this took me 20 minutes to run due to the large number of installs required.
  4. Cleanup downloaded libraries (remove tarballs, zip files, etc): ```sh conda clean -tp ```
  5. ```sh source activate fcnd ``` to activate the environment (you'll need to do this whenever you want to work in this environment).
  
### Backyard Flyer Setup
  1. Navigate to your ```sh FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit ``` directory.
  2. Clone the backyard flyer repository. ```sh git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Backyard-Flyer.git ```
  3. Navigate to that repo. ```sh cd FCND-Backyard-Flyer ```
  

***To run the above solution, replace the ```sh backyard_flyer.py``` within the ```sh FCND-Backyard-Flyer ``` directory with one provided above.
