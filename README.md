This project was a basic introduction to the Udacidrone simulator, programming the quadrotor as a state machine, and creating waypoints for your quadrotor to follow -- as seen in backyard_flyer.py.

## To complete this project on your local machine, follow these instructions:
### Environment Setup (~30 minutes)

### Setup Instructions (abbreviated)
Read through the instructions below. If these commands look familiar to you, then you should use these VERY abbreviated instructions to get yourself set up.
  1. [Download Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and then install by opening the file/app that you download.
  2. ```sh git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit.git ``` to clone the starter kit and then ```sh cd FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit ``` nto that directory. If you have a windows machine, you must rename ``sh meta_windows_patch.yml ``` to ```sh meta.yml ``` as well.
